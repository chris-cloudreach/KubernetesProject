# Scale up the MongoDB deployment to two replicas instead of just one

# echo Edit the deployment descriptor:
kubectl edit deployment mongodb -n robot-shop
# You should see some YAML describing the deployment object.

# Under spec:, look for the line that says replicas: 1 and change it to replicas: 2.
# Save and exit.

# echo Check the status of the deployment with:
kubectl get deployment mongodb -n robot-shop

# After a few moments, the number of available replicas should be 2.
